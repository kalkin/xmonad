About
-----
This repository contains my own Xmonad config.  It's actually kind of a Haskell
program. So it's really helpful if you understand the basics of functional
programming and Haskell.

Documentation

For more documentation about the used Extensions (the import stuff) look at
http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Doc-Extending.html      

If you have further questions about writing an own Xmonad config, don't hesitate
